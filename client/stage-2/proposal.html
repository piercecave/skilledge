    <!-- Problem Description -->

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>The climbing community of Washington has been steadily <a href="http://parkways.seattle.gov/2015/08/27/rock-climbings-history-and-rising-popularity-inspires-seattle-festival/">growing in the past several years</a>. In Seattle it's 
            easy to analyze the growing popularity of emerging climbing gyms the likes of <a href="https://seattleboulderingproject.com/">The Seattle Bouldering Project</a>
            or <a href="https://www.stonegardens.com/seattle/default.aspx">Stone Gardens</a>. As Seattlites begin to train at these gyms and grow stronger 
            in their ability to handle difficult problems they begin to venture out into the Cascades and look for climbing routes
            out on actual cliffs and walls. Knowing how to start finding places to climb seems almost impossible to some of
            these novices in the field and takes people away from experiencing the climbing Washington has to offer.  
        </p>
        <p>The heart of the problem lies within a lack of information. Newer climbers have not been acredited with the knowledge
            that several more experienced climbers in the field have. Going online and individually looking up seperate routes of a
            climb to piece together a weekend trip into the mountains or having to buy guide books specfic to a region in the Olympic
            mountains to navigate the area has now become a dated process that seems solvable through information technology. 
        </p>
        <p>Currently there exists a great webstie called <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/">Mountain Project</a> that hits
            a huge part of the information problem of getting climbers to learn and hear about new routes. However, this site is more structured 
            as a forum for verteran climbers to discuss fun additions into the climbing community's arsenal of new routes and caters
            towards a much broader audiance then neccessary to solve the problem in Washington State. The strongest function of their site
            is the route finder that they display at the top of their home page. By entering in a skill level and the level of difficulty at
            which a user is comfortable climbing; the site will find routes for the user to climb in their area. This feature will be something that I 
            will try to emulate in my own interpretation of solving the information problem present in Seattle currently.

    <!-- App Description -->
    <section>
        <h3>App Description</h3>
         <p> The users will consist of primarily newer climbers in the Greater Seattle Area as well as seasoned climbers
            of local gyms that haven't taken the initiative to get outside to cliffs across the state. I decided on this user base
            because the ultimate end game is to eliminate the gap of knowledge between people who know about outdoor climbing and
            people who have only climbed in a gym their whole life. Solving this particular problem of the whole set will in turn resolve
            the other issues of getting people outside and meeting the request of information for an underrepresented population that's
            growing quickly. 
        </p>
        <p>Interacting with this web app will do a variety of things. The primary function will be to serve as a transition from a gym climbing 
            routine to getting out on an actual rock. Users will input information about what they've been climbing and what they are comfortable
            climbing at and the web app will return an entire trip specifying what they will need, where they need to go, how long the whole trip
            will take and reviews on the quality of the trip overall. The following illustrates how a user might interact with the application. 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The user is placed in the home page after navigating to the site. On the first page the user inputs their <em>level of
                experience</em> in climbing and a <em>location</em> into a text box. 
            </li>
            <li>The app searches the Mountain Project Data API for routes fufilling those needs indicated. The user recieves a selection
                of dates and times to chose from in the form of text boxes and buttons. 
            </li> 
            <li>The user then selects from a variety of trips that display as images on the page of where they could go in the amount of time
                the user specifies as appropriate. 
            </li>
            <li>The user is given location that then then maps out to where he/she will be climbing.</li>
            <li>The user can then navigate from a list of supplies recomended for the trip the user will be partaking on.</li>
            <li>The entie trip summary is generated and saved for the users benefit to access at a later time. Accessed by renavigating to the site.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Using the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/data">Mountain Project Data API</a> I can access routes by lat and lon to find exactly where the climbing routes are located
            and where users should navigate to in order to start their trip. By turning the process of making these trips into an enjoyable experience I hope it 
            opens up a whole new market for climbing in the Seattle area and encourages further exploration into how to get more people
            outside.
